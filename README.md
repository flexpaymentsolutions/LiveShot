# Acknowledgements
Kudos to [Kenneth Gómez](https://github.com/KennethGomez). Not only is LiveShot a very functional screenshot utility, it's a textbook example of the MVVM/DI patterns and best of all, it's KISS+DRY with no dependencies on the
"flavor-of-the-month" architectural frameworks. If you want to learn or see a modern, non-web, desktop WPF example of dependency injection, services, eventing, and configuration binding, this is it.

# Updates
- Bumped to .NET 8
- Separated the capture UI from its original example app so it can be referenced by other projects
- Added a very basic WPF demo app showing it's usage as a "one-shot" instantiation

# LiveShot
Tool to make enhanced screenshots. Inspired on LightShot

## How it works
With this tool you can select some rectangle on your screen and then draw on it like you can do on LightShot.

### Key binding resizing
Whenever you crop a screenshot you can move or resize it with the arrow keys.
- If you press these keys with `Shift` (no matter which shift) it will enter resize mode.
- If you press these keys with `Control` (no matter wich control) it will do resizing or moving every 10 pixels.

Whenever you're drawing with any draw tool you can update its stroke thickness pressing `Control` and moving the mouse wheel or with the keys `+` and `-`

### Drawing tools
With this application, like LightShot you can draw lines, arrows, rectangles inside the screenshot and those graphics will get merged with the screenshot whenever you're saving or uploading the image.

### Eye dropper tool
With this tool you can select a color from the screenshot you took with the help of a magnifier.
If you press `Shift` key when clicking a pixel to pick a color it will copy the hexadecimal color value to you clipboard.
